<p>The name is set using JavaScript. Use the developer tools to find the code which sets the name.</p>

<p>Links on a page can open a new window.</p>
<p>This might be done using the <code>target</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Links can also be implemented using JavaScript to open a window with a specific name associated with it.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>Window names can be used to switch back and forward between the windows.</p>
<h2 id="dev-tools">Dev Tools</h2>
<p>Use the dev tools to inspect and explore the page DOM to understand the controls.</p>
<p>You can also use the JavaScript console to show the current window name:</p>

</code></pre>
