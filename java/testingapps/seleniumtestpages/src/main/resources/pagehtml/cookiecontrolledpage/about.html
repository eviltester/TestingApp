<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>This page simulates a login process.</p>
<p>You should not be able to visit the AdminView or SuperAdminView
    pages without being &#39;logged in&#39; as the correct the user</p>
<p>You should only be able to visit the SuperAdminView
    page when logged in as <code>SuperAdmin</code>.</p>
<p>And (once logged in) you should not be able to come back to this page until you logout.</p>
<p>Try it and see - and use dev tools to mess with the cookie or try and inject a cookie with your automated execution</p>
<p>When you type in the correct username (e.g. Admin) and password (AdminPass), a cookie is created, and you are redirected to the associated &#39;Admin View&#39; page.</p>
<p>Users:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Admin</code> / <code>AdminPass</code></li>
    <li><code>SuperAdmin</code> / <code>AdminPass</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The Cookie represents a session cookie that would be created upon successful login for a normal login process.</p>
<p>Each page has JavaScript that detects the cookie.</p>
<p>You can only access the <a href="/styled/cookies/adminview.html">AdminView page</a> or <a href="/styled/cookies/superadminview.html">SuperAdminView page</a> when the cookie is set.</p>
<p>When the cookie is set the <a href="/styled/cookies/adminlogin.html">login page</a> will redirect you to the AdminView Page.</p>
<p>Use the <code>AdminLogout</code> link to remove the cookie.</p>
<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
<p>Using your Automated Execution tool you should be able to create a cookie and bypass the login process.</p>
<p>Injecting cookies is often done during Automated Execution to speed up access to a logged in section of an application.</p>
<h2 id="cookie-inspection-and-manipulation">Cookie Inspection and Manipulation</h2>
<p>Use the Browser Dev Tools to inspect the cookie and find the correct format and information to add.</p>
<p>You can also change the cookie details and delete them using the Browser Dev Tools to help you with your testing.</p>
