<div class="explanation">
    <p>This page implements multiple ways initiating a file download.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 id="download-files">Download Files</h2>
<p>File Downloads are relatively easy to test.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click Download</li>
    <li>Check Results</li>
</ul>
<p>They are sometimes a little harder to automate.</p>
<h2 id="automating-download-files">Automating Download Files</h2>
<p>One approach to automating Downloads is to use an HTTP library and directly pull down the file.</p>
<p>The other is to use the default functionality in your chosen Browser Automating Tool and trap the file download.</p>
<h2 id="page-functionality">Page Functionality</h2>
<p>The page has multiple approaches to generating the file.</p>
<p>No JavaScript is used so each link or button has a reference to the file URL.</p>
<p>Some of these connect directly to a file on the server, some make a server call which generates and returns the file.</p>
<h2 id="automating">Automating</h2>
<p>Try and trigger each download mechanism using both direct and browser based automating.</p>
<p>Make sure to compare the results of the download to what you expected.</p>
