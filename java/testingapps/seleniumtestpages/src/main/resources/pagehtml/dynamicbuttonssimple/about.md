# About Simple Dynamic Buttons

<div class="explanation">
        <p>Click all 4 dynamic buttons.
        </p>
</div>

## Functionality

All the buttons are added to the page dynamically using JavaScript.

- 1) Click the `Start` button to reveal button `One`.
- 2) Click the `One` button to reveal button `Two`.
- 3) Click the `Two` button to reveal button `Three`
- 4) Click the `Three` button to end the challenge.
- 5) When the challenge is complete the text `All Buttons Clicked` will be displayed.

Each button is on an increasing delay so you have to synchronize on the button becoming available.

## Testing

This set of buttons is also suitable as an Exploratory Testing Challenge.
