        <p>Find By Playground has a lot of nested elements.

## Simple List?

The page looks like a simple list of elements with no hierarchy.

In reality, when you examine the DOM, you'll see that the paragraphs with `nested para text` are heavily nested.

Use this to experiment with as many locator strategies as you can.

e.g. 

- id
- name
- css and xpath path based on relative locators
