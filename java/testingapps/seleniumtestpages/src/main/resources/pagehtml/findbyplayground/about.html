<div class="explanation">
    <p>Find By Playground has a lot of nested elements.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- TOC -->

<h2 id="simple-list-">Simple List?</h2>
<p>The page looks like a simple list of elements with no hierarchy.</p>
<p>In reality, when you examine the DOM, you&#39;ll see that the paragraphs with <code>nested para text</code> are heavily nested.</p>
<p>Use this to experiment with as many locator strategies as you can.</p>
<p>e.g. </p>
<ul>
    <li>id</li>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>css and xpath path based on relative locators</li>
</ul>
