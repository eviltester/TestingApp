## HTML Form

This HTML Form shows a simple form with no validation.

It contains a variety of input types introduced with HTML5:

- colour picker
- date
- date and time
- email
- month
- number  

These controls are complex, but since they are implemented by the browser we don't really need to 'test' them, we need to test that the backend system can process the values in them.

## Validation

No extra validation has been added to the form, but you will notice that some of the fields have default validation.

## Synchronization

No synchronization is required for this page or the results page triggered by `submit`.

## Results Page

The results page will show you the details you typed in, and those fields which had no values.

There are a lot of location possibilities and attributes on the results page to assert that your entered details are passed through to the server.

## Dev Tools

Use the dev tools to inspect and explore the page DOM to understand the controls.
