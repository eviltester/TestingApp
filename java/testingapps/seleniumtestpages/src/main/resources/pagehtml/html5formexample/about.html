<h2 id="html-form">HTML Form</h2>
<p>This HTML Form shows a simple form with no validation.</p>
<p>It contains a variety of input types introduced with HTML5:</p>
<ul>
    <li>colour picker</li>
    <li>date</li>
    <li>date and time</li>
    <li>email</li>
    <li>month</li>
    <li>number  </li>
</ul>
<p>These controls are complex, but since they are implemented by the browser we don&#39;t really need to &#39;test&#39; them, we need to test that the backend system can process the values in them.</p>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>No extra validation has been added to the form, but you will notice that some of the fields have default validation.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>No synchronization is required for this page or the results page triggered by <code>submit</code>.</p>
<h2 id="results-page">Results Page</h2>
<p>The results page will show you the details you typed in, and those fields which had no values.</p>
<p>There are a lot of location possibilities and attributes on the results page to assert that your entered details are passed through to the server.</p>
<h2 id="dev-tools">Dev Tools</h2>
<p>Use the dev tools to inspect and explore the page DOM to understand the controls.</p>
