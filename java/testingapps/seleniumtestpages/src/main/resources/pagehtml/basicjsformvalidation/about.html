<h2 id="html-form">HTML Form</h2>
<p>This HTML Form shows a simple form with validation.</p>
<p>Both fields use the same validation routine.</p>
<p>The validation is triggered <code>onblur</code> i.e. when data is entered in the field and the field loses focus.</p>
<p>The validation is also triggered when the <code>Submit Value</code> button is used to send the details to the server so the form should only submit when the values are correct.</p>
<p>One of the input fields is plain text, and the other is set to only accept <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>The validation failure is shown to the user via a JavaScript <code>alert</code>.</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>This page has at least one bug, so it is possible to use this form as a testing exercise as well as practicing automating.</p>
<h2 id="results-page">Results Page</h2>
<p>The results page will show you the details you typed in.</p>
<p>There are a lot of location possibilities and attributes on the results page to assert that your entered details are passed through to the server.</p>
<h2 id="dev-tools">Dev Tools</h2>
<p>Use the dev tools to inspect and explore the page DOM to understand the controls.</p>
<p>You could also review the JavaScript and check the validation mechanisms.</p>
