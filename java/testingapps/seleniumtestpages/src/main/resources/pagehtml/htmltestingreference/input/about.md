# Input

'input' element - input fields are a way of allowing the user to enter information, it is usually used in a form to submit information to the server.

The MDN documentation has a useful section on [Client Side Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#client-side_validation) which is worth reading.

But that section doesn't go far enough to describe the various ways that the client side validation can be bypassed and over-relied on.

Important attributes are:

- type - the type of the input field
- [hidden](input-type-hidden.mdx) which prevents display of the field but submits it to the server
- [text](input-type-text.mdx) a free format single line entry field
- [number](input-type-number.mdx) creates a GUI control that only allows number entry

## Types

There are many 'types' of input and some have more nuances than others e.g. 'number' because it allows non-numeric input characters for scientific notation.

Shown below are `input` different types, these have some JavaScript event handling code which will show output in the console when you interact with them.

It is important to:

- recognize that the controls are complex browser provided controls. We do not want to test these controls.
- understand that at some point we will either use JavaScript to 'get' the value, or send the value to the server, we do want to test that our application can handle any 'value' generated by the control.

## Basic Types

### Hidden

```html
<input type="hidden" defaultValue="bob"/>
```

[more info on hidden](input-type-hidden.mdx)

### Button

```html
<input type="button" value="A Button"/>
```

### Checkbox

```html
<input type="checkbox"/>
```

### Radio

```html
<input type="radio" name="choice" value="One"/>
<input type="radio" name="choice" value="Two"/>
```

## Text Input Elements

The following are all plain text controls. The concept that a field might be a "Url" or "Email" suggests that additional validation is available but any validation is created by the developer, usually by using the [`pattern` attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp).

The pattern attribute is a regex and needs to be tested. Because it is a Regex it could be automatically checked against a wide range of input data.
Browsers may style the fields differently.

A few gotchas:

- sometimes the `size` and `maxlength` attributes get mixed up, `size` controls the display width of the input, `maxlength` the maximum number of characters that can be entered.
- [size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/size)
- [maxlength](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength)

Take care about [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) values to make sure there is no accidental information bleed or chance of misuse or setting the wrong values in a form.

### Text

`<input type="text" defaultValue="bob"/>`

### Search

`<input type="search"/>`

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search)

### Password

`<input type="password"/>`

Note: just because you "can't see the input" doesn't mean the input is 'safe', the value can be retrieved by JavaScript. And make sure that any use of "password" is only used on a page served and processed via `https`.

Notes:

- `autocomplete` has some values [specifically for passwords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) e.g. `new-password`, `current-password` - make sure these are not misused.
