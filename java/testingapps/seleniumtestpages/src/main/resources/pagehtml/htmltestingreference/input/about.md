## About the Example Page

The example page is a form, with a range of input types.

There is no JavaScript validation on the form. Any validation is added from the `type` value itself.

- The `reset` input type will reset any data in the form
- The `image` and `submit` types will submit the form (which is basically just refresh the page).

Events are added to the form dynamically so when you interact with the form you will see events listed in the JavaScript console. You can toggle display of event information in the page by pressing the `Toggle` button.


## About `input` Elements

'input' element - input fields are a way of allowing the user to enter information, it is usually used in a form to submit information to the server.

The MDN documentation has a useful section on [Client Side Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#client-side_validation) which is worth reading.

But that section doesn't go far enough to describe the various ways that the client side validation can be bypassed and over-relied on.

Important attributes are:

- `type` - the type of the input field
   - `hidden` which prevents display of the field but submits it to the server
   - `text` a free format single line entry field
   - `number` creates a GUI control that only allows number entry
- `required` - defines if a value in the `input` field is required

`input` elements are often used within a `form`. In the example page, all the `input` elements are in a form. You can see that the "Form Control" `input` elements control the form to some extent, resetting data, or submitting the form. When a form is submitted, some of the input types provide some validation protection e.g. email, url, etc.

## Types

There are many 'types' of input and some have more nuances than others e.g. 'number' because it allows non-numeric input characters for scientific notation.

Listed below are different `input` different types with explanations.

It is important to:

- recognize that the controls are complex browser provided controls. We do not want to test these controls.
- understand that at some point we will either use JavaScript to 'get' the value, or send the value to the server, we do want to test that our application can handle any 'value' generated by the control.

- [mdn docs on different types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)

## Basic Types

### Hidden

```html
<input type="hidden" value="bob"/>
```

- cssSelector: `input[type="hidden"]`

Hidden input elements are a common source of issues. They often give too much information away e.g. private details of the user.

There is a global attribute to hide 'things' from rendering, but the hidden type is different and is especially problematic. A hidden input is not shown on screen but is submitted to the server when a form is submitted.

They sometimes allow escalation of privilege e.g. a hidden field for 'usertype' if amended to 'admin' might change the user permissions for a request. They sometimes feed information to the server that should be pulled from the database e.g. a hidden field on a 'add to cart' or 'checkout' form which has the item price, if this is used to calculate the price on the server then it is possible for the user to amend it and get items for free or even a refund (-ve amount as value).

If any 'hidden' field is important and used in the processing then it needs validation applied prior to processing. Too many development teams make the assumption that the hidden values can not be changed by the user. But they can.

Testers can amend the values using Dev tools, or by amending the HTTP request through a proxy or in the network tab.

- [mdn web docs about hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden)

Test Ideas:

- Amend the value of the attribute, when you now submit the form for processing did it make a difference?
- What happens if you amend the DOM and add a hidden field with the same name before or after the one in the form? Use different values, which field value is used?  
- If the value is base64 then decode it and see what it tells you.

### Button

```html
<input type="button" value="A Button"/>
```

### Checkbox

```html
<input type="checkbox"/>
```

### Radio

```html
<input type="radio" name="choice" value="One"/>
<input type="radio" name="choice" value="Two"/>
```

## Text Input Elements

The following are all plain text controls. The concept that a field might be a "Url" or "Email" suggests that additional validation is available but any validation is created by the developer, usually by using the [`pattern` attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp).

The pattern attribute is a regex and needs to be tested. Because it is a Regex it could be automatically checked against a wide range of input data.
Browsers may style the fields differently.

A few gotchas:

- sometimes the `size` and `maxlength` attributes get mixed up, `size` controls the display width of the input, `maxlength` the maximum number of characters that can be entered.
- [size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/size)
- [maxlength](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength)

Take care about [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) values to make sure there is no accidental information bleed or chance of misuse or setting the wrong values in a form.

### Text

```
<input type="text"/>
```

- cssSelector: `'input[type="text"]'`

Text input fields are often a source of issues when used for non-text data. There are many types available e.g. date, time, number, and these specialised types offer some input validation. "text" offers no default input validation, although it should remove new-line characters. This means that if 'text' is used, the system validation needs to handle any input. There are additional attributes that can help provide client side validation e.g. pattern, required etc.

Test input fields often have javascript events associated like 'onchange' so check the event listeners to make sure you test the JavaScript.

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text)

Test Ideas:

- "Should this really be free text? If additional validation is added to check it is a 'number' or a 'date' then there are actual domain types for that."
- "Check the associated attributes e.g. required, maxlength are they correct?"
- "Try a range of invalid characters"
- "What happens if this is left blank?"


### Search

`<input type="search"/>`

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search)

### Password

`<input type="password"/>`

Note: just because you "can't see the input" doesn't mean the input is 'safe', the value can be retrieved by JavaScript. And make sure that any use of "password" is only used on a page served and processed via `https`.

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password)
- [web.dev sign in form best practicises](https://web.dev/sign-in-form-best-practices/#current-password)

Notes:

- `autocomplete` has some values [specifically for passwords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) e.g. `new-password`, `current-password` - make sure these are not misused.

### Email

`<input type="email"/>`

### Url

`<input type="url"/>`

### Tel

`<input type="tel"/>`

## Number Controls

### Number

`<input type="number" value="10"/>`

Number is not restricted to positive Integer so it is possible to add characters that the server or follow on functionality is not expecting e.g. "-.e" so we need to try the full range of input characters.

- cssSelector: `'input[type="number"]'`

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number)


Test Ideas:

- Number may include characters you don't expect, try them e.g. "e", ".","-","+"
- Try changing the type to "text" and submitting a very invalid input.

### Range

`<input type="range"/>`


## Special Format Controls

### Color

`<input type="color"/>`

### Date

`<input type="date"/>`

### DateTimeLocal

`<input type="datetime-local"/>`


### File

`<input type="file"/>`

### Month

`<input type="month"/>`

### Time

`<input type="time"/>`


## Form Controls

### Reset

`<input type="reset"/>`

### Image

`<input id="image-input" type="image" src="button_image.png"/>`

### Submit

`<input type="submit"/>`

## Form Validation

### Required

When a form is submitted, some of the input types provide some validation protection e.g. email, url, etc.

The validation is only applied when a value is entered in the field.

In order to make a field mandatory an HTML designer can use the `required` attribute.

e.g.

```
<input type="text" name="author" required/>
<input type="text" name="title" required="yes/>
```

- cssSelector: `'[required]'`

The 'required' attribute prevents a form being submitted when any input field (`input`, `select`), with this attribute present, does not have a value.

NOTE: the `required` attribute does not need a value, and any value can be used for the attribute e.g. `required="required"`, `"required="blue apples"`

Like any other `boolean` attribute, I'm suspicious if a `required` attribute has a value, this often means that the people working on the front end don't fully understand HTML and may indicate that I need to look at the implementation of the GUI more closely. e.g. `required="false"`

Test Ideas:

- Try removing any 'required' attribute and then submit the form without a value in the field.
- Try removing the field element completely and see what the backend server does.
