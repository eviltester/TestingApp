<h2 id="download-files">Download Files</h2>
<p>File Downloads are relatively easy to test.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click Download</li>
    <li>Check Results</li>
</ul>
<p>They are sometimes a little harder to automate.</p>
<h2 id="automating-download-files">Automating Download Files</h2>
<p>One approach to automating Downloads is to use an HTTP library and directly pull down the file.</p>
<p>This is slightly harder to do when the file download initiates from JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>The page has multiple approaches to generating the file.</p>
<p>The common theme is that none of the buttons or links connects to the file directly. They have to be clicked, then the file download is initiated.</p>
<p>Any Automated Execution has to trap or handle the background file download.</p>
<h2 id="automating">Automating</h2>
<p>Try and trigger each download mechanism using browser based automating.</p>
<p>Make sure to compare the results of the download to what you expected.</p>
