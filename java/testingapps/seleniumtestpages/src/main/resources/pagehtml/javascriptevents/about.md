# About JavaScript Events Page

<div class="explanation">
        <p>JavaScript implemented functionality can be triggered by many different events. Experiment using this page.

## About Page

Not all functionality is based around a 'click' event. We might encounter systems based around 'blur' or 'mousedown' or a whole host of other "it made sense at the time" or "because on this device...".

So we have to learn how to handle different events.

Each of the buttons on the page has a different triggering event, try to trigger them.

The button will be disabled when the event is triggered.

## Triggering

Try to trigger the events:

- using automated execution tooling
- manually using mouse and keyboard
- from the console using JavaScript
