<h2 id="about-page">About Page</h2>
<p>Not all functionality is based around a &#39;click&#39; event. We might encounter systems based around &#39;blur&#39; or &#39;mousedown&#39; or a whole host of other &quot;it made sense at the time&quot; or &quot;because on this device...&quot;.</p>
<p>So we have to learn how to handle different events.</p>
<p>Each of the buttons on the page has a different triggering event, try to trigger them.</p>
<p>The button will be disabled when the event is triggered.</p>
<h2 id="triggering">Triggering</h2>
<p>Try to trigger the events:</p>
<ul>
    <li>using automated execution tooling</li>
    <li>manually using mouse and keyboard</li>
    <li>from the console using JavaScript</li>
</ul>
