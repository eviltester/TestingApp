<h2 id="about-page">About Page</h2>
<p>This page has input validation using JavaScript, HTML5 and there is associated server side validation.</p>
<p>Validation Requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>firstname must be filled</li>
    <li>firstname must be less than 90 chars</li>
    <li>surname should be between 11 and 79 chars  </li>
    <li>age between 18 and 80</li>
    <li>max &quot;Notes&quot; length is 2000</li>
    <li>country must be from list</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automated-execution">Automated Execution</h2>
<p>For automating, it is a relatively simple form with a submission.</p>
<p>Automate this through the UI and check the results on the page displayed by the server.</p>
<h2 id="http-execution">HTTP Execution</h2>
<p>You could automate server side validation directly by issuing HTTP requests.</p>
<p>It may be faster to execute a lot of coverage by issuing HTTP requests directly.</p>
<p>Try to automate via HTTP requests and increase the coverage of the data used.</p>
<h2 id="exploratory-testing">Exploratory Testing</h2>
<p>For exploratory testing, this page may have been coded with some bugs.</p>
<p>Some test approach ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Explore the validation on client side</li>
    <li>Does the server side validation match the client side?</li>
    <li>Do all the client side validations match up? Do the JavaScript validation match the HTML5 validations?</li>
    <li>Explore state changes and observe the GUI.  </li>
    <li>Could you automate tactically with tool support to increase the data coverage? e.g. proxy tools, browser plugins, or API automating tools. </li>
</ul>
