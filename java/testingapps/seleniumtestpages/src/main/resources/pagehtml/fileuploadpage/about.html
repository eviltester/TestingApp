<h1 id="about-file-upload-page">About File Upload Page</h1>
<div class="explanation">
    <p>This page allows you to upload a file. Note: this will not save the file to the server. And there may be a file upload size limit.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 id="safe-upload-file">Safe Upload File</h2>
<p>This upload process goes through the full uploading process but does not save your file to the server. This means you are safe to use any file.</p>
<p><em>Be careful with all Test Practice Applications on the internet because some of them do save your file, and make it available to anyone to download.</em></p>
<p><strong>Never use private or confidential material or any files that you would not want to make public.</strong></p>
<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>Choose the file from your local drive.</p>
<p>Choose the type of file.</p>
<p>Click &quot;Upload&quot;.</p>
<p>The file length will be checked and when the &#39;upload&#39; is successful you will be redirected to the &quot;Uploaded File&quot; page.</p>
<h2 id="automating">Automating</h2>
<p>Because the File Upload Dialog is a native dialog to the browser, it is not something we would want to automate. Prior to tool support we did have to automate the native dialog.</p>
<p>Most automated execution tools now have special approaches for amending the file upload field.</p>
<p>In WebDriver <code>find</code> the <code>input</code> element and use <code>sendKeys()</code> to type in the absolute path of a local file.</p>
<h2 id="saving-the-file">Saving The File</h2>
<p>If you run the test pages app locally then you can save files that are uploaded.</p>
<p>Additionally if you are running the application locally, when you upload an image, the image will be displayed on the <code>Uploaded File</code> page.</p>
