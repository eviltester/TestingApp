<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p><a href="https://eviltester.com">I (Alan Richardson)</a> created this, because I believe the best way to improve your testing skills is to practice.</p>
<p>Learning how to practice is a skill that takes time.</p>
<p>Testing is a rich and varied process. There are many different ways of viewing a system and exploring its functionality. Each exercise and test page will pay dividends on repeat visits.</p>
<p>The more you learn how to practice, the more value you can get from these pages.</p>
<p>Patreon supporters can download a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/75068248">free 205 page ebook of exercises and notes</a> based on one of these pages, the <a href="/styled/apps/7charval/simple7charvalidation.html">7 Char Validation application</a>.</p>
<p>The secret to Software Testing is Taking Action. When we are faced with a system that we don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t know how to test, then we try, we explore. By taking action we learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>what we don&#39;t know and can then investigate and research to allow us to proceed.</li>
    <li>what paths are open to us and we can quickly proceed to exploration.</li>
</ul>
<p>We learn by doing.</p>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>Some of the examples are suitable for manual exploratory testing, learning HTML, learning Technical Web Testing, and JavaScript hacking.</p>
<p>The &quot;About&quot; page for each of the practice pages should provide more hints, tips and possibly sample exercises.</p>
