## Simple Todo List

[Simple Todo List](https://eviltester.github.io/simpletodolist/todolists.html)

- Suitable for practicing: Automating, Testing, JavaScript Hacking

A Simple Todo List Application written with HTML and JavaScript, and using Local Browser Storage. Based on the [Vanilla JS Todo MVC Project](https://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/). But heavily re-written to simplify, add more bug and automation potential, and add an admin feature set.

The application was used as the sample app in my [Linkedin Learning Course Selenium WebDriver Page Objects and Abstractions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-selenium-page-objects-and-gui-automation)


## Swag Labs

[Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com)

- Suitable for practicing: Automating, Testing

A dummy e-commerce site. First login, with one of the users.
Each user is in a different 'account state' to expose different
scenarios.

Then there are a bunch of shopping cart scenarios to explore.

The application is written in React and uses LocalStorage.

## Swagger Petstore

## The-Internet

[The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)

- Suitable for practicing: Automating

A list of sample pages, each offering a variety of controls to experiment with.

Be careful because the 'upload' page will upload your content. And it can be
downloaded from the download page. Do not download anything already there as
you don't know what it contains. And do not upload anything you don't want
everyone to see.

## The Pulper

[The Pulper](https://thepulper.herokuapp.com/apps/pulp/)

- Suitable for practicing: Automating, Exploratory Testing, REST API

A sibling site to this one. 

The Pulper is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a pulp book and magazine collection.

Everything runs in memory so there is no database to worry about.

The Pulper has multiple versions built in, the drop down admin menu allows selecting a version, or you can choose a version from the “Help” page.

The Pulper comes with built in canned data so you can instantly start navigating around and getting a feel for the application.

The application has some deliberate bugs, some of which are fixed in later versions of the app.

I created an [exclusive course and workbook for Patreon Supporters](https://www.testerhq.com/member2/index.php?course=the_pulper_technical_testing_workshop&page=coursecontents&preview=true) describing how to use this to practice testing.

## UI Test Automation Playground

[UITAP](http://uitestingplayground.com/)

- Suitable for practicing: Automating

A clean set of examples to work through.
