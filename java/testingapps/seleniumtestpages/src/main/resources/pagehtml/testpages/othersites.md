# Other Practice Sites

<div class="explanation">
        <p>This is not the only practice site online. We've listed a few other
sites that we know of below, that we think offer useful testing and automating challenges.</p>
<p>You can use these for automation testing practice and develop your test automation skills. The applications may well repeat similar components but the more you automate and practice the better you get.</p>
<p>NOTE: We have only listed sites that were created as practice applications and those without extensive and intrusive ads.</p>
<p>They are presented in Alphabetic order.</p>

## How to Use These Testing Practice Sites

This list of websites to practice test automation are not something to look at once. We recommend re-visiting the sites you like best and trying multiple ways to automate and test the examples.

On each practice session you can try new approaches. I regularly revisit my own practice test applications and find new bugs and new ideas for practicing.

### For Automating

If you are using these sites to practice your automating and test automation skills then I recommend:

- creating a public repository on Github where you can store all your code. This can act as a showcase for your developing automation skill.
- create a repo for each tool or language that you use, rather than for each site. This helps demonstrate your skill with the tool.

### For Testing

- Make notes about your testing, using different styles. e.g. Mind Maps, Diagrams, State Transition Models, text files.
- Make your notes public, either in a Github repo or on a blog. This helps demonstrate that you are serious about improving your skills and showcases your approaches.

Be careful because the 'upload' page will upload your content. And it can be
downloaded from the download page. Do not download anything already there as
you don't know what it contains. And do not upload anything you don't want
everyone to see.

## The Test Pages

[![The Test Pages Screenshot](/images/othersites/testpages-300x300.png)](https://testpages.eviltester.com/)

## The Pulper

[The Pulper](https://thepulper.herokuapp.com/apps/pulp/)

- Suitable for practicing: Automating, Exploratory Testing, REST API

A sibling site to this one. 

The Pulper is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a pulp book and magazine collection.

Everything runs in memory so there is no database to worry about.

The Pulper has multiple versions built in, the drop down admin menu allows selecting a version, or you can choose a version from the “Help” page.

The Pulper comes with built in canned data so you can instantly start navigating around and getting a feel for the application.

The application has some deliberate bugs, some of which are fixed in later versions of the app.

I created an [exclusive course and workbook for Patreon Supporters](https://www.testerhq.com/member2/index.php?course=the_pulper_technical_testing_workshop&page=coursecontents&preview=true) describing how to use this to practice testing.
