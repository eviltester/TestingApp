<div class="explanation">
    <p>Framesets are deprecated in HTML but periodically used.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>The example has a set of nested frames. The <code>frame</code> elements are contained in <code>frameset</code> elements.</p>
<h2 id="frames">Frames</h2>
<p>Frames are rarely used since pages have to conform to an invalid HTML approach.</p>
<p>The page has to have no <code>body</code> tag.</p>
<p>Make sure to inspect the page to double-check this.</p>
<p>The frame contents can be well form html. But the parent page with the <code>frameset</code> has no <code>body</code>.</p>
<h2 id="automated-tools">Automated Tools</h2>
<p>Most automated tools have commands dedicated to working with frames.</p>
<p>In WebDriver you would <code>switchTo().frame(...)</code> the frame to work with it.</p>
