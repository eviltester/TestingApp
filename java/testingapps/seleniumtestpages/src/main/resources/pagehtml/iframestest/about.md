# About iFrames Example

<div class="explanation">
        <p>iFrames are regularly used on web pages to embed content.
        </p>
</div>

## Example

The example page has a set of iFrames.

The `iframe` elements are added to a page like any other element.

They are often used to embed content from another site e.g.

- Youtube Video Players
- Podcast Audio Players

They can also be used to pull in content from the same domain.


## Automated Tools

Most automated tools have commands dedicated to working with iframes.

In WebDriver you would `switchTo().frame(...)` the `iframe` to work with it.
