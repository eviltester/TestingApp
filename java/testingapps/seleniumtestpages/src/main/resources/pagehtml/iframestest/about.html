<p>The example page has a set of iFrames.</p>
<p>The <code>iframe</code> elements are added to a page like any other element.</p>
<p>They are often used to embed content from another site e.g.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Youtube Video Players</li>
    <li>Podcast Audio Players</li>
</ul>
<p>They can also be used to pull in content from the same domain.</p>
<h2 id="automated-tools">Automated Tools</h2>
<p>Most automated tools have commands dedicated to working with iframes.</p>
<p>In WebDriver you would <code>switchTo().frame(...)</code> the <code>iframe</code> to work with it.</p>
