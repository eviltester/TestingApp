<h2 id="javascript-hacking">JavaScript Hacking</h2>
<p>The main note taking application code is accessible in the <code>document</code>, so it is possible to work with the loaded and stored data entirely from the console using JavaScript.</p>
<p>This might help with the creation of test data and automating without using the UI.</p>
