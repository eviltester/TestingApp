## HTML Tables

Many web sites now use nested divs and complicated HTML to represent tabular data but for simple mult-column data lists you can't beat an HTML table.

This `table` has headers and columns.

Only the table itself has an id so you'll have to use a variety of techniques to pull the information out of the table and check it against your expected results.

The table is not dynamic so you don't have to worry about any synchronization.
