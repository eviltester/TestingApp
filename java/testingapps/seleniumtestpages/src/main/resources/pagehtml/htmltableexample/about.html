<h2 id="html-tables">HTML Tables</h2>
<p>Many web sites now use nested divs and complicated HTML to represent tabular data but for simple mult-column data lists you can&#39;t beat an HTML table.</p>
<p>This <code>table</code> has headers and columns.</p>
<p>Only the table itself has an id so you&#39;ll have to use a variety of techniques to pull the information out of the table and check it against your expected results.</p>
<p>The table is not dynamic so you don&#39;t have to worry about any synchronization.</p>
