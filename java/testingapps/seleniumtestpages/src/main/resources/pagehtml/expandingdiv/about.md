# About Expanding Div

<div class="explanation">
        <p>A slowly expanding div with a link to click.
        </p>
</div>

## Automating Expanding Div

This is a CSS implemented expanding div.

Since it slowly reveals its contents, it requires a more sophisticated approach to synchronisation.

## All in DOM

Because the contents of the Div are in the DOM from the start, it is very important to synchronize on the full contents being visible prior to clicking on the link.
