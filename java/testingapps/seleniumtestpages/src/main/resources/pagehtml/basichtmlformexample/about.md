## Synchronization

No synchronization is required for this page or the results page triggered by `submit`.

## Results Page

The results page will show you the details you typed in, and those fields which had no values.

There are a lot of location possibilities and attributes on the results page to assert that your entered details are passed through to the server.

## Dev Tools

Use the dev tools to inspect and explore the page DOM to understand the controls.
