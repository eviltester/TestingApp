# About Multiple Progress Bars

<div class="explanation">
        <p>This page has progress bars buttons representing some 'behind the scenes' processing. Which progress points can you synchronise on?
        </p>
</div>

## Do Nothing

This page does not require any input from you.

The progress bars will automatically start working.

You could do nothing and simply synchronize on "Stopped".

But you can do better than that...

## Multiple Tasks

Can you check that the tasks finish in order?

- Task 1, Task 2, Task 3

Can you check that the tasks all hit their checkpoints?

Task 1 and 2 have 4 stages. Task 3 has 8 stages.
