<h2 id="do-nothing">Do Nothing</h2>
<p>This page does not require any input from you.</p>
<p>The progress bars will automatically start working.</p>
<p>You could do nothing and simply synchronize on &quot;Stopped&quot;.</p>
<p>But you can do better than that...</p>
<h2 id="multiple-tasks">Multiple Tasks</h2>
<p>Can you check that the tasks finish in order?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Task 1, Task 2, Task 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you check that the tasks all hit their checkpoints?</p>
<p>Task 1 and 2 have 4 stages. Task 3 has 8 stages.</p>
