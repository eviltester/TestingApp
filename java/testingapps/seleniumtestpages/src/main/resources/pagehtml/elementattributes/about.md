# About Element Attributes Page

<div class="explanation">
        <p>Elements can have attributes. This test page has sample paragraphs with attributes to explore.
        </p>
</div>

## Use Dev Tools To Inspect The Page

Use the inbuilt browser developer tools to inspect the DOM.

You'll see that there are attributes on the paragraph elements.

Try and find these using a variety of locators.

## Dynamic Attributes

The `Add Another Attribute` button will dyamically add a new
attribute to a paragraphs. As well as increasing the value of
an Attribute.

Consider how you would test and automate this. Also are there any
risks associated with this functionality?

## Auto Dynamic Attributes

The last test paragraph has a static id, but other attributes are dynamically updating.

Try waiting for a specific attribute value.
