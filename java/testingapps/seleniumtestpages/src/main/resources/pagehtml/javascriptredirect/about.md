# About JavaScript Redirect Page

<div class="explanation">
        <p>Click a button and a timed event will redirect you to a new page.
        </p>
</div>

## Buttons

Each button will redirect you to the same page, but the time taken to redirect will be different.

- 5 seconds
- 2 seconds

## Testing

How would you test this?

- What time boundary is acceptable?
- How would you time it?

## Automating

Automating this is pretty simple, click the button, check the redirect.

- Should you check the count down timer?
- Should you assert on the messages displayed?
- How much leeway do you give to the timing?
