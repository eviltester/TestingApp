## The Pulper

The Pulper is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

The data sets are Pulp Magazine editions from the 30s and 40s because, frankly, who doesn't love reading pulp magazines.

## Data

The data has a variety of publishers, magazines and series pre-populated.

## Entities

The main entities are:

- Publisher - who has published a magazine
- Author - person who wrote the story
- Series - the series or 'hero' e.g. The Spider
- Book - an actual edition of a magazine

Book brings all of the entities together in that a Book has a publisher, an Author (multiple authors often), belongs in a Series and also has a House Author.

Note, not all pulp magazine fit into this model. Since this is a test app I don't really mind.

## Screens

We have a variety of screens showing clickable reports, lists of stuff, create screens, edit/amend screens and you can delete Entity Instances (e.g. a book) from the edit screens.

I'm sure you'll find your way around.

## Versions

You can find different versions of the app downloadable from Github

- https://github.com/eviltester/TestingApp/releases

The different versions may be easier to automate, harder, different stylings, buggy etc.


## Pulp Magazines

It can be outrageously expensive to collect original pulp magazines and they have a tendency to fall apart when you try to read them.

Fortunately Archive.org whave quite a lot of [scanned pulps](https://archive.org/details/pulpmagazinearchive).

Sadly, the pulp archive above does not seem to have any issues of The Spider, or Doc Savage but there are companies still [reprinting these today](http://www.thepulp.net/the-hunt/reprints-replicas/).

I highly recommend hunting out reprints of:

- The Spider
- The Avenger
- Doc Savage
- The Shadow
- Operator 5

Or you could read easier to get hold of reprints e.g. HP Lovecraft, or Robert E Howard's Conan or Solomon Kane.
